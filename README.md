**Descriptive Statistics** 
Descriptive statistics involves describing, summarizing and organizing the data, so it can be easily understood 
Graphical display are often used along with the Quantitative measures to enable clarity of communication 
- Used to describe, organise and summarise information about an entire data set 
- So that it can be easily understood
- Graphical display are often used along with the Quantitative measures to clearly communication findings
- I.e 5% defect product production rate


<br>


## Inferential statistics

- Used to generalise about a data set based on a sample of data
- I.e 5% defect product production rate of 30 projects ‚Äî> 5% defect product production rate

<br>

**Variance**
- œÉ2 sigma squared is the symbol for variance
- mathematical terms frequently used in statistics and probability theory
- Variance refers to the spread of a data set around its mean value
- AKA the more clumped the data, the less variance there is in the values of the dataset. Where as a high variance will have numbers spread across the board. 
- ‚ÄúIf you pick a number, what are the chances its around the mean?‚Äù


**Standard Deviation**
- Any data set that represents a Bell curve/normal distribution can be very useful. Because now Standard deviation applies to this dataset, we can extract cool information from it
- œÉ - greek sigma
- measures the spread of the data about the mean value (average)
- It is useful in comparing sets of data which may have the same mean but a different range
- For example, 
    - the mean of the following two is the same: 
     - 15, 15, 15, 14, 16 	(avg 62)
      - 2, 7, 14, 22, 30. 	(avg 62)
      - However, the second is clearly more spread out. 
    - low standard deviation = the values are not spread out and clumped around the mean
    - high standard deviation = the values are spread out and the curve is ‚Äòflatter‚Äô
    - How do the values deviate from the standard mean

**Sum Notation - ‚àë [Ààs…™…°m…ô]**

![For writing a sum in a short form, one often uses Greek letter E](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662034-de712cfd-00e4-41e8-a564-e0ba00c13c54.png)

<br>

**Covariance**
- covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. 
- The metric evaluates how much ‚Äì to what extent ‚Äì the variables change together.
- Covariance values are not standardised
- E.G: COVID cases increase - available hospital beds decrease ‚Äî Increase in daily exercise - decrease in weight
- Measures how 2 data sets Correlate	
- 1 = as one grows, the other also grows as much
- -1 = as one grows, the other shrinks as much
    - Covariance is when two variables vary with each other, whereas 
    - Correlation is when the change in one variable results in the change in another variable.

![E(x-N(-Y where X = 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662037-2c05c6ae-78f2-47f5-a328-eed98f3f1734.png)

*Source: https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/mean-median-mode-and-range-posters-12024923* 

<br>

**Correlation**
    - Covariance is when two variables vary with each other, whereas 
    - Correlation is when the change in one variable results in the change in another variable.
- IS covariance BUT not just linear direction but ALSO strength
- Based on covariance
- Covariance values are standardised

![Cov(X, Y)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662041-d90873ba-c496-44bb-bbfc-c04bf3deff3d.png)

*Source: https://www.datadeck.com/en/blog/2018/11/28/data-analytics-correlation-vs-causality/* 


<br>

**Model**  
- Example: An ice cream company keeps track of how many ice creams get sold on different days(real world data). 
- By comparing this to the weather on each day they can make a mathematical model of sales versus weather. 
- They can then predict future sales based on the weather forecast, and decide how many ice creams they need to make ahead of time

<br>

**Probability and Statics are polar opposites**
- Probability creates models from real world data
- Statistics creates real world data from models

## Probability

*Counting (Permutation & Combination)* 


<br>

**Combinations**
- When the order of the data set does not matter, it is a combination


<br>

**Permutation**
- When the order of the data set does matter, it is a permutation
- A permutation is a ordered combination
- 2 types of permutation
    - Repetition is allow - e.g a password 3333
    - Repetition is not allowed - e.g if 3 people are running a race, they can not all be 1. It must be 1 2 and 3
- Repetition - Easy - n^r
    - A lock has n dials from 1-10. That is n x n x n, or 10x10x10. Or 1000 possible combinations 
    - Or, more properly written n^r. N is the number of dials, r is the range (1 to 10)
- No repetition - okay - !n
    - Example: what order could 16 pool balls be in?
    - E.g 1:    the idea is -> we pick ball x. Now there is 15 left. We pick ball y. Now there are 14 left
        - 16 √ó 15 √ó 14 √ó 13 √ó ... = 20,922,789,888,000
    - E.g 2:   we only want the permutations of 3 pool balls
        - 16 √ó 15 √ó 14 = 3,360
        - In other words, there are 3,360 different ways that 3 pool balls could be arranged out of 16 balls.
    - We write this as Factorial. 
        - 16 balls 	=	 !16   		=   16 √ó 15 √ó ... 					= 20,922,789,888,000
        - 3 balls 	=	 !16  /  !13   	=   16 √ó 15  x ‚Ä¶   /  13 √ó 14  x ‚Ä¶ 		= 3,360

**Probability**
- Number of Desired outcome / number of total possible outcomes 
- Number of times ill drink water a day / number of times a drink anything a day

 Probability ‚Äì the chance that an uncertain event will occur (always between 0 and 1) 
 Impossible Event ‚Äì an event that has no chance of occurring (probability = 0) 
 Certain Event ‚Äì an event that is sure to occur (probability = 1)

**What‚Äôs the probability of having breast cancer?** 
- 1% of women have breast cancer
- A woman got a mammogram detection of a breast cancer
- 80% of mammograms detect breast cancer when it is there
- 9.6% of mammograms detect breast cancer when it‚Äôs not there 
- 1 around 80%, 2 over 50% 3 between 10% and 50% 4 less than 10% 


<br>


**Basic probability** 
- Probability ‚Äì the chance that an uncertain event will occur (always between 0 and 1) 
- Impossible Event ‚Äì an event that has no chance of occurring (probability = 0) 
- Certain Event ‚Äì an event that is sure to occur (probability = 1) 


<br>

**Assessing probability** 
- A Priori (Classical approach) ‚Äì based on prior knowledge of the process 

![probability of occurrence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662121-2bd65940-b3b7-4337-a906-ac95fe1f12af.png)
- Empirical probability (Relative frequency) ‚Äì based on observation from experiment or historical events

- Subjective probability ‚Äì based on a combination of an individual‚Äôs past experience, personal opinion, and analysis of a particular situation 


<br>

**A Priori (Classical Approach)** 
- Rolling two dice and probability of the total outcomes becomes {2, 3, ..., 12} 
![P(2) = 136](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662126-ca505be0-314d-4e53-b95e-25f2410ce59d.png)

<br>


**Subjective Probability** 
- ‚ÄúIn the subjective approach we define probability as the degree of belief that we hold in the occurrence of an event‚Äù 
- E.g. weather forecasting‚Äôs ‚ÄúP.O.P.‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúProbability of Precipitation‚Äù (or P.O.P.) is defined in different ways by different forecasters, but basically it‚Äôs a subjective probability based on past observations combined with current weather conditions. 
- POP 60% ‚Äì based on current conditions, there is a 60% chance of rain (say). 


<br>


**Event** 
- Simple event
	- An event described by a single characteristic o e.g. A day in January in 2020 
- Joint event
	-  An event described by two or more characteristics
	- e.g. A day in January that is also a Wednesday in 2020 
- Complement of an event A (denoted Ac)
	- All events that are not part of event A
	-  e.g. All other days in 2020 that are not in January

**Organising and visualising events** 

![Venn Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662132-6f6859bd-f4f7-49e6-9328-c2d9b0f4971b.png)

**Joint, Marginal, Conditional Probability...** 
We study methods to determine probabilities of events that result from combining other events in various ways. 
There are several types of combinations and relationships between events: 
- Complement event
- Intersection of events
- Union of events 
- Mutually exclusive events 
- Dependent and independent events 


<br>

**Complement of an Event...** 
The complement of event A is defined to be the event consisting of all sample points that are ‚Äúnot in A‚Äù. 
Complement of A is denoted by Ac
The Venn diagram below illustrates the concept of a complement. 

P(A)+P(Ac )=1

**Intersection of Two Events...** 
![The intersection of events A and B is the set of all sample points](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662145-77f546f5-8e17-4674-bbef-2f535ccd30b0.png)

**Union of Two Events...** 
The union of two events A and B, is the event containing all sample points that are in A or B or both: 
Union of A and B is denoted: A or B 
![Screenshot 2022-01-14 at 21 42 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662150-69712b98-fff2-45d4-a4f1-8be88ac73b60.png)

**Mutually Exclusive Events...** 
![When two events are mutually exclusive (that is the two](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662154-4a18fcd8-c581-467e-971f-15bca1a109b6.png)

**Marginal Probabilities...** 
![Alternatively, we could introduce shorthand notation to represent the events](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662159-b6fa6eca-64bb-4182-a6d4-2316e3982ba7.png)

**Union...** 
![Marginal probabilities are computed by adding across rows and down](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662160-ffd7b047-a52a-4771-8190-3b32ccf151a5.png)

![We stated earlier that the union of two events is denoted as A or B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662167-efed86c5-e079-42bc-82d7-6ffb17bbcba0.png)


<br>

**Example 6.7...** 
In a large city, two newspapers are published, the Sun and the Post.
- 22% of the city‚Äôs households have a subscription to the Sun
- 35% subscribe to the Post.
- A survey reveals that 6% of all households subscribe to both newspapers. 
What proportion of the city‚Äôs households subscribe to either newspaper? 
- P(Sun or Post) = P(Sun) + P(Post) ‚Äì P(Sun and Post) =.22+.35‚Äì.06=.51 
‚ÄúThere is a 51% probability that a randomly selected household subscribes to one or the other or both papers‚Äù 
6.44 


<br>

**Conditional Probability...** 
Conditional probability is used to determine the probability of one event given the occurrence of another related event. 
Conditional probabilities are written as P(A | B) and read as ‚Äúthe probability of A given B‚Äù and is calculated as: 

![P(A and B)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662171-375f2ee9-1b30-4001-9ac2-54992b088ea0.png)

Example 6.2 What‚Äôs the probability that a fund will outperform the market given that the manager graduated from a top-20 MBA program? 
Recall: 
A1 = Fund manager graduated from a top-20 MBA program 
A2 = Fund manager did not graduate from a top-20 MBA program 
B1 = Fund outperforms the market 
B2 = Fund does not outperform the market Thus, we want to know ‚Äúwhat is P(B1 | A1) ?‚Äù 

![P(A, and 3,  11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149662174-a757a317-5c96-475d-ab6e-837152607296.png)


<br>


**Independence...** 
The probability of one event is not affected by the occurrence of the other event. Two events A and B are said to be independent if 

		P(A|B) = P(A) 
	or
		P(B|A) = P(B) 




<br>

**Binomial Distribution ‚Äì Conditions and Criteria** 
* Rule 1: Situation where there are only two possible mutually exclusive outcomes (for example, yes/no survey questions). 

* Rule2: A fixed number of repeated experiments and trials are conducted (the process must have a clearly defined number of trials). 

* Rule 3: All trials are identical and independent (identical means every trial must be performed the same way as the others; independent means that the result of one trial does not affect the results of the other subsequent trials). 

* Rule: 4: The probability of success is the same in every one of the trials.

**Confidence Interval for Population Mean (when population STD(œÉ) is unknown)** 
* If the population standard deviation œÉ is unknown, we can substitute the sample standard deviation, s 

* This introduces extra uncertainty, since s varies from sample to sample

## Hypothesis Test

- Hypothesis test ‚Äì Z test, t test ÔÅ¨ Critical value and p-value
- One-tail test and two-tail test ÔÅ¨ Type I, II error 

**Hypothesis Testing** 
- While you‚Äôre traveling, you met a gambler
	-  He bet $1 for a head, and me bet $1 for a tail
	- He won the game 7 times straight
	- You claim that the coin is not a normal one
	- But he argued that it was an absolute coincidence, nothing‚Äôs impossible in the probability distribution ÔÇß How would you argue? 

<br>

**Hypothesis testing is a process of testing the hypothesis with pre- 
defined confidence level**
- A hypothesis is a claim about a population parameter (e.g. mean)
- Sample mean is estimated
- Checks whether the sample mean is within the confidence interval from the claimed mean (i.e. the hypothesis) 


<br>

**Terminology**
- Null hypothesis (H0): a claim to be test
- Alternative hypothesis (H1): the opposite of the null hypothesis
- Significance level: interval for the rejection (Œ±)
- Confidence level: interval for the acceptance of the H0, ( (1- Œ±) x 100% ) 

<br>


- Confidence level = (1 ‚Äì Œ± ) x 100%
- Confidence coefficient = 1 ‚Äì Œ±
- Level of Significance (probability corresponding to 2 tail) = Œ± 
![Region of](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664330-1141c134-26cc-4af2-ac83-0725404f86c9.png)

**Hypothesis Testing Process** 
![Claim The population mean age is 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664337-11ecb13f-309d-47a0-8a01-1eedfbc6cf0c.png)


- Suppose the sample mean age was 20, (ùëã = 20) 
- Check where the sample mean falls on (1) rejection region, (2) non- rejection region 
![Pre-defined](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664339-b687ea2a-d372-4112-ae77-834d4a0bdd16.png)


<br>


**Hypothesis Testing ‚Äì Example 1** 
- A manufacturer claims that the average lifetime of a light bulb is 1,000days. (standard deviation: 100days) 
- An inspector found that the sample mean of 100 bulbs is 990 days 
- Test null hypothesis (H0: life-time is 1,000 days) with 5% of 
significance level (i.e. Œ± = 0.05) 


<br>


**Hypothesis Testing ‚Äì Example 1 (x value)** 
- H0 are not rejected as the ùëã value is within the interval 
![1,000 - 1 96‚Ä¢-00u  = 980 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664347-5ea6f805-f9ba-4ee2-bc57-ec6bb6646a0a.png)



<br>


**Hypothesis Testing ‚Äì Example 1 (z value)** 
- You can check the region with ZSTAT value 
![990- 1,000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664360-bf62e35d-a150-4f34-a4e9-a8ef7a18f9bb.png)


<br>

**Hypothesis Testing ‚Äì Example 1 (p value)** 
![You can check the p-value of ZsTAT (-1 0)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664367-6da559b3-1c26-432d-85b4-a1933e4bca4d.png)


**Hypothesis Testing ‚Äì Example 2 (p-value)** 
* 	A manufacturer claims that the mean diameter of a manufactured bolt is 30mm. (Assume œÉ = 0.8) 

* 	Test the claim with significant level of 5% 

* 	Sample mean from 100 samples was 29.84

<br>


**Hypothesis Testing when œÉ is known**
- Z-Test is used when the population standard deviation is known 
![Hypothesis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664377-cf7e5ce8-2cc4-4fe0-b6cf-60fa406bc5f8.png)

<br>

**Hypothesis Testing ‚Äì Example 3 (t-test)** 
- The average price of a hotel room in NY is said to be $168 per night. 
- A random sample of 25 hotels is taken, ùëã = $172.50 and s = $15.40. 
- Test null hypothesis with 5% of significance level (i.e. Œ± = 0.05) 
![Ho p = 168](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664411-dfbbd9f3-da6f-4ce2-beb7-550d93a451da.png)


<br>

**One-Tail Tests** 
- In many cases, the hypothesis focuses on a particular direction 
![This is a lower-tail test since the alternative](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664421-30c514ba-becb-4bb6-87be-31ef4d6000b3.png)

**Lower-Tail Tests** 
- There is only one critical value, since the rejection area is in only one tail

## Regression

**Linear Relationship** 
![Any relationship between the two variables with the data below](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664476-4eedc650-e4d8-410f-95c2-e64c52a45384.png)

<br>

**Introduction to Regression Analysis** 
- Dependent variable:
	- The variable we wish to predict or explain (e.g. heating cost)
	- Typical symbol is Y. 
- Independent variable(s):
	- The variable used to predict or explain the dependent variable. 
	- E.g. temperature, insulation, age of boiler, number of windows 
	- Typical symbol is X. 


<br>

**Introduction to Regression Analysis** 
- Regression analysis is used for:
	-  Explaining the impact of changes in independent variable(s) on the 
dependent variable.
- Predicting the value of a dependent variable based on the value of independent variable(s). 


<br>

**Simple Linear Regression Model** 
- Only one independent variable, X
- Changes in Y are assumed to be related to changes in X 
![Constant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664480-28f7d6dd-c74a-4828-b01c-fb75e3b42ccf.png)

<br>

**The Least Squares Method** 
- b0 and b1 are obtained by minimizing the sum of the squared 
![differences between Y and Y](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664485-806b578d-c4eb-4cb8-bee8-e56290893792.png)

<br>


**Simple Linear Regression Example** 
- A real estate agent wishes to examine the relationship between the selling price of a home and its size (measured in square feet) 
- A random sample of 10 houses is selected
	- Dependent variable (Y) = house price in $1000s 
	- Independent variable (X) = square feet

**Multiple Regression** 
- Often we can obtain more accurate forecasts if we include more  independent variables in our regression model. 
	- Example) heating cost would be affected by not only the size but, temperature, insulation, age of boiler, number of windows as well.
- Allows effect of changes in some variables to be investigated while  others are held constant. 

<br>

**Multiple Regression Model** 
- Idea: Examine the linear relationship between 1 dependent (Yi) and 2 or more independent variables (Xi) 
- Multiple Regression Model with k Independent Variables: 

![¬•-intercept](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664567-741c5b5e-f564-4676-b325-71d1e1a8d8bc.png)

<br>

**Example: two Independent Variables** 
- A distributor of frozen dessert pies wants to evaluate factors thought to influence demand 
	- Dependent variable: Pie sales (units per week) o Independent variables: Price (in $) Advertising ($100‚Äôs) 
- Data are collected for 15 weeks 


**Example: two Independent Variables** 
![Pie Sales](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664580-1a1adb75-1f18-4e0b-ab9d-154663583079.png)

<br>

**R2 vs. Adjusted R2**
- r2 never decreases even if an irrelevant new X variable is added to the model
- This can be a disadvantage when comparing models 

<br>

 **Adjusted r2** 
- Penalize when adding a new variable 
- If the new variable is very useful, adjusted r2 will still increase 
![Penalized portion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664586-1ebb460f-202a-44c1-8572-e055b8c3e278.png)


<br>

**Using Dummy Variables** 
- A dummy variable is a categorical independent variable with two levels: 
	- yes or no, on or off, male or female
- If more than two levels, (number of levels - 1) number of dummy 
variables are needed.
	- Spring, summer, fall, winter ÔÉ® 3 dummy variables are needed 


<br>


**Dummy-Variable Example** 
- Let the regression model be
	- Y = pie sales per week
	- X1 =pricein$
	- X2 = holiday ( b2 = 1 if a holiday occurred during the week, 0 otherwise) 

![Y =b, +b,X, +b,X,](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664591-199a6347-3f40-424d-89c5-7737787bea2a.png)

<br>

**Dummy-Variable Example (more than 2 levels)** 
- Let the regression model be
	- Y = heating cost
	- X1 = square feet
	- X2 = 1 if summer, X3 = 1 if winter, (spring/fall be the default category) 

![Y =b, +b,X, +b,X, +b,X,](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664599-b5654ca4-c3b0-49da-9169-2d726d662473.png)

<br>

**Nonlinear Relationships** 
- Plots show we are fitting a linear model to a relationship that is non- linear (e.g. cost vs capacity). 
- If there is a pattern in residuals, we have missed something. 
![Capacity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51651537/149664606-b818f9a6-81e8-4897-ad96-5a4d31d800f1.png)


<br>

**Nonlinear Relationships** 
- Non-linear relationship can be transformed to linear relationship

- After the transformation, the adjusted r2 increases

**The problem of multicollinearity** 
- Occurs when there‚Äôs high correlation between the independent variables. 
- Independent variables contribute redundant information to the model. 
- Problems:
	- The coefficients estimated cannot be trusted.
	- The coefficients might even have the wrong signs. 
- Indications:
	- Intuitively Incorrect signs on the coefficients.
	- When a new variable is added to the model, there‚Äôs a large change in the value of a previous coefficient. 



<br>

**Detecting and solution to the multicollinearity** 
- Run a separate regression with one suspicious variable as dependent and all the others as independent variables. 
	- If r2 > 0.8, then it‚Äôs regarded as there‚Äôs a multicollinearity issue
